      Most of Singapore’s trash is incinerated Singapore disposes of much of
      its waste through waste-to-energy initiatives especially incineration.
      With a whopping 7.23 million tonnes of solid waste generated, it is almost equivalent to more than 3200 Olympic-sized pools!

          Waste that is thrown down the rubbish chute is collected by waste collectors and
          transported to four waste-to-energy plants –
          Tuas, Senoko, 
          Tuas South and Keppel Seghers Tuas.

          The refuse trucks tip their waste load into a bunker where crane
          operators mix the waste to ensure the composition is homogenous,
          before feeding the waste into the incinerators. The incineration
          process reduces the volume of waste by up to 90%. The heat
          produced is harnessed to produce electricity, which is fed into the
          national grid.

      In 2019, about 7.23 million tonnes of solid waste was generated, of which 4.25
      million tonnes were recycled. The 6% reduction in the amount of waste
      generated compared to 2018 is the third yearly reduction since 2017. It is a
      positive step in Singapore's journey towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation,
      and to prolong the lifespan of Semakau Landfill beyond 2035. Waste
      generated by the non-domestic and domestic sectors both saw a reduction in
      2019 - from 5.70 million tonnes and 2.00 million tonnes respectively in 2018, to
      5.37 million tonnes and 1.87 million tonnes respectively in 2019.

      Overall, the recycling rate decreased from 61% in 2018 to 59% in
      2019. The drop in the overall recycling rate in 2019 is largely attributable to the
      drop in the recycling rate of paper. The market for recycled paper was affected
      by shrinking export markets and reduced demand for printing paper from
      increasing digitalisation.

        Despite awareness-raising campaigns to encourage a 3R (reduce, reuse and

        recycling rate decreased from 75% in 2018 to 73% in 2019– only 4% of plastic and 18%
